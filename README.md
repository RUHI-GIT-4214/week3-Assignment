Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Open Sales Dataset.This assignment performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a public sales dataset using Python and Google Colab. The objective is to clean the data, visualize trends, correlations, and outliers, and derive actionable business insights to support data-driven decision-making.
